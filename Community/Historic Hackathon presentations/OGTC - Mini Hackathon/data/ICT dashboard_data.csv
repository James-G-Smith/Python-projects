24/11/2017,Queensland Health is driving a huge eHealth Strategy to keep pace with the increasing demand for digital health services, to shift towards a customer-centric health system, and to enable cutting edge health service delivery.
24/11/2017,Central to the eHealth strategy is addressing issues related to ageing systems, in particular addressing the risk to health service delivery, and removing barriers to contemporary practice.
24/11/2017,Currently, eHealth Queensland is hosting a number of mission critical applications on the ageing application server platform. While this platform has provided a robust and highly available environment, it is now seven years old with increased risks to reliability and serviceability, has limited options for expansion, and is unable to provide the agile foundation required for advancing the eHealth Strategy. As such, it is an appropriate time to investigate replacement of the platform.
